				<p class="megafield">Carlos Ray "Chuck" Norris born March 10, 1940 is an American martial artist and actor. After serving in the United States Air Force, he began his rise to fame as a martial artist, and has since founded his own school, Chun Kuk Do.

Norris appeared in a number of action films, such as Way of the Dragon, in which he starred alongside Bruce Lee, and was The Cannon Group's leading star in the 1980s.[2][3] He played the starring role in the television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 until 2001.
Norris is a devout Christian and politically conservative. He has written several books on Christianity and donated to a number of Republican candidates and causes. In 2007 and 2008, he campaigned for former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who was running for the Republican nomination for President in 2008.[4] Norris also writes a column for the conservative website WorldNetDaily.[5]

As a result of his hypermasculine image, an Internet phenomenon began in 2005 known as Chuck Norris facts, ascribing various implausible or impossible feats to Norris.</p>
